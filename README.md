Random Game was created as a testing grounds for using pygame.

The game is simple:
  1. A red circle is displayed on a small screen, whereupon clicking the circle will replace its location on the screen.
  2. If a location on the screen outside of the circle is clicked, the circle will shrink.
  3. The game ends by missing the circle three times.

In the future, other features to the game may be added, such as:
  - A 20-second timer that will end the game and display the player's score.
  - A sandbox-style gamemode where the following variables can be chosen in-game:
    1. Amount of circles on the screen at a time
    2. Circle radius
